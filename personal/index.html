        <p><span>Edmund is a writer whose favorite hobby is making words into things and things into words for Grovemade. He’s also a member of the production team and a personal levitation consultant! When not conjuring up wordy ideas or refining his sanding techniques, he can be found floating idly above busy intersections and reciting the many volumes of random but highly worthwhile trivia he’s compiled over the years. Though he’s too shy to say it, he’d be pleased as punch if you took a looksy at his authorial pursuits <a href="http://edmundsandovalfiction.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</span><br></p>

        <p><span>Victor, aka Victor Sweet, aka Victor Strong is not only one of our awesome production team members but he’s also one of our most powerful Grovemaders. Victor’s secret for superhuman &nbsp;strength? A steady diet of hip-hop, rap, R&amp;B and heaping scoops of white hot magma. When through with his morning routine of deadlifting small cars and tiny houses, you’ll find him fishing the banks of the Columbia River, where he reels in trolley-sized carps with his steely bare hands and a visage of extreme aplomb. When not performing unmatchable feats of strength, you’ll find this dynamo enjoying the many tasty tidbits found far and wide in our fair city.</span><br></p>

        <p><span>Mustafa is our accountant who tolerates our overhead paper planes with deep breaths and a smile on his face. He’s a supporter of Portland’s soccer and basketball teams, the Timbers and the Trailblazers, as well as our local efforts to make Portland a sustainable city. He also prioritizes being a loving son, brother, and husband, despite his family’s insistence that they traded a couple household items for him when he was a baby.</span><br></p>
